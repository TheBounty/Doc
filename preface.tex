TheBounty Renderer\footnote{https://www.thebountyrenderer.org} is a free and open source\footnote{TheBounty Renderer is available under the LGPLv2.1 license.} montecarlo raytracer.

\bigskip

Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through the 3D scene. This technique reproduces the natural behaviour of light and its particular effects on surfaces, such as reflection and refraction, caustics and indirect lighting between diffuse surfaces.

TheBounty usually works as add-on or plugin to a 3D software to provide raytracing capabilities on demand though it can work as a stand-alone program as well. Blender 3D is the main host application of TheBounty at the moment but there are always on-going projects to add TheBounty support on other 3D packages and modellers.

TheBounty integration in Blender is fairly complete and stable but it should be always considered as a work in progress as Blender and TheBounty keep on evolving.

\textbf{TheBounty Renderer} is a fork of the popular \textit{YafaRay}\footnote{http://www.yafaray.org} raytracer, which itself is a continuation of the \textit{Yafray} (short for ``yet another free raytracer'') raytracer.
